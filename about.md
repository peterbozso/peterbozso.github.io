My name is Péter Bozsó and I am a consultant specialized in Microsoft technologies.
Recently I am focusing on chatbots on the front-end and microservices on the back-end, doing all these while relaying on the power of Azure.

I was building UWP applications for devices with different form factors including smartphones, tablets, PC-s and many more for years. I have a lot of experience with cross-platform mobile development (especially Xamarin) as well.

During my free time, I am an enthusiastic FOSS contributor and I find great delight in working with anything inside the domain of Internet of Things.
